### Exercise 1: Provide storage for the IT department testing and training

#### Objective:
To create a storage account for the IT department's testing and training purposes.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a resource group**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to "Resource groups" and click on "+ Create".
   - Provide a name and select a region for the resource group.
   - Review and create the resource group.

2. **Create a storage account**:
   - Navigate to "Storage accounts" and click on "+ Create".
   - Choose the previously created resource group.
   - Provide a unique name for the storage account.
   - Set performance to Standard.
   - Review and create the storage account.

3. **Configure basic settings**:
   - Set redundancy to Locally-redundant storage (LRS) for cost-effectiveness.
   - Enable secure transfer required with TLS version 1.2.
   - Disable storage account key access.
   - Allow public network access from all networks.

#### Reasoning:
- **Resource Group**: Provides a logical grouping of resources for easier management and organization.
- **Storage Account**: Serves as the storage solution for testing and training data.
- **Basic Settings Configuration**: Optimizes the storage account for low-cost usage while ensuring secure transfer and access control.

### Exercise 2: Provide storage for the public website

#### Objective:
To create blob storage for hosting the public website with high availability and versioning.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a storage account**:
   - Follow the steps provided in Exercise 1 but choose Geo-redundant storage (GRS) for high availability.

2. **Configure public access**:
   - Enable anonymous access to the blob storage.
   - Create a blob storage container with anonymous read access.

3. **Enable soft delete and blob versioning**:
   - Enable soft delete for 21 days.
   - Enable blob versioning to keep track of document versions.

#### Reasoning:
- **Storage Account Configuration**: Chooses GRS for high availability to ensure the website remains accessible even during regional outages.
- **Public Access Configuration**: Allows anonymous access to the website content for public viewing.
- **Data Protection Configuration**: Implements soft delete and blob versioning to protect against accidental deletion and maintain document versions.

### Exercise 3: Provide private storage for internal company documents

#### Objective:
To create private storage for internal company documents with high availability and shared access signature.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a storage account**:
   - Follow the steps provided in Exercise 1 but choose Geo-redundant storage (GRS) for high availability.

2. **Create a private storage container**:
   - Create a container with private access.
   - Upload files for internal use.

3. **Configure shared access signature (SAS)**:
   - Generate SAS with read-only access for external partners.
   - Test access to ensure restricted permissions.

4. **Implement lifecycle management**:
   - Move blobs to the cool tier after 30 days for cost optimization.

#### Reasoning:
- **Storage Account Configuration**: Chooses GRS for high availability to ensure data accessibility.
- **Private Container Creation**: Ensures privacy and security by restricting access to internal company documents.
- **SAS Configuration**: Provides controlled access for external partners while maintaining data security.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Optimizes storage costs by moving less frequently accessed data to the cool tier.

### Exercise 4: Provide shared file storage for the company offices

#### Objective:
To create a storage account for shared file storage across company offices with snapshots and restricted access.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a storage account**:
   - Create a premium storage account for Azure Files with zone-redundant storage.

2. **Configure file share and directory**:
   - Create a file share and directories for different departments.
   - Upload files and enable snapshots for data protection.

3. **Restrict access to specific virtual networks**:
   - Configure storage access from selected virtual networks only.

#### Reasoning:
- **Storage Account Configuration**: Chooses premium storage for optimal performance and reliability.
- **File Share Configuration**: Organizes data into directories for better management and enables snapshots for data protection.
- **Access Restriction Configuration**: Ensures data security by allowing access only from authorized virtual networks.

### Exercise 5: Provide storage for a new company app

#### Objective:
To create storage for a new company app with managed identities, key vault integration, and encryption.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a storage account and managed identity**:
   - Follow the steps provided in Exercise 1.
   - Create a managed identity and assign appropriate permissions for access.

2. **Secure access with key vault and key**:
   - Create a key vault and key for storing access keys securely.

3. **Configure storage to use customer managed key**:
   - Integrate the storage account with the key vault and specify the managed key for encryption.

4. **Implement time-based retention policy and encryption scope**:
   - Configure time-based retention policy for immutable storage.
   - Create an encryption scope with infrastructure encryption enabled for enhanced security.

#### Reasoning:
- **Managed Identity Configuration**: Provides secure access to the storage account for the new company app.
- **Key Vault Integration**: Safely stores access keys and manages encryption keys.
- **Customer Managed Key Configuration**: Enhances security by using customer-managed keys for encryption.
- **Policy and Encryption Scope Implementation**: Ensures data integrity and confidentiality by enforcing retention policies and encryption at the infrastructure level.
